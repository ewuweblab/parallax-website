09:12:28 From P. Colin Manikoth to Everyone:
	Now find a UN-professional example.
09:12:38 From Laurel Peterson to Everyone:
	I think that this movie poster is professional because it does a good job of capturing the general ambiance of the film. It is also well thought out. The design is retro/vintage. The illustration looks authentic to the era that the movie is set in. Overall, this shows that a lot of creativity went into making the poster.
09:15:09 From Tyana Ackerman to Everyone:
	Professional design example because the design was done with the knowledge and awareness that WFH is still what most people are doing and is also becoming more and more what people are wanting and preferring to do; therefore, designing and creating an event/experience for the user(s) not just for the heck of it: https://isaackuula.com/works-googleio.html
09:16:16 From P. Colin Manikoth to Everyone:
	Isaac is an alum.

09:16:51 From Tyana Ackerman to Everyone:
	I know. He does great work. Ginelle suggested a while ago I look into him and his work
09:16:57 From Laurel Peterson to Everyone:
	https://cleancutmedia.com/advertising/pretzel-crisp-says-you-can-never-be-too-thin This design is unprofessional because the message offends people. The design itself is also boring. The idea is poorly thought out.
09:17:34 From Anthony Riojas to Everyone:
	I think the design layout for this social media is very neat and organized. A different experience and emotion brought into an application that is very tedious.
09:32:16 From P. Colin Manikoth to Everyone:
	Per year, how much money does Colin Manikoth make from EWU?
09:37:20 From P. Colin Manikoth to Everyone:

	What is your hourly rate?
09:41:07 From P. Colin Manikoth to Everyone:
	???
09:41:16 From Tyana Ackerman to Everyone:
	It surprises me the difference between same level professors/employees just within different departments that donâ€™t have that much difference
09:41:28 From Anthony Riojas to Everyone:
	25 at least
09:41:43 From Tyana Ackerman to Everyone:
	$23-$25 probably to start out
09:45:07 From Tyana Ackerman to Everyone:
	But yet that also depends on what I end up wanting to doâ€¦UX designer? Motion designer? etc. Lotâ€™s of thinking to doâ€¦
